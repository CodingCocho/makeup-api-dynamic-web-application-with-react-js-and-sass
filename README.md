# Learning outcomes
This was my first web application where I had to learn dynamic routing from react-router and it was a concept I really wanted to learn so I incorporated it using an API which allowed me also to learn how to use axios. I learned the best practices for creating a React Application by following the coding guidelines set by AirBnB. In addition I was able to incorporated Redux into the application after following their essentials tutorial and creating my own Blogging Web App. I worked on using Javascript logic by coding algorithms inside utility functions that would be used by Redux store's reducers. Furthermore, I learned how to make all my components and pages bind to the redux store so that when a dispatch or hook is used elements are rendered with correct and accurate data.

# Challenges
The notable challenged I faced was rendering my data on to my application. The first thing to note is the loading time for the products in the Catalog and the product itself in the Product page is quite long and also every time the user wants to go back to the catalog, it has to render again thus creating an annoyance for the user. I am working on fix for this using Redux on my next project.
